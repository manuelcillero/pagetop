# üîÉ Dependencies

PageTop is developed in the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and stands on
the shoulders of giants by leveraging some of the most robust and renowned libraries (*crates*) from
the [Rust ecosystem](https://lib.rs), including:

* [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) for web services and server management.
* [Tracing](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tracing) for diagnostics and structured logging.
* [Fluent templates](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/fluent-templates), which integrate
  [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) for internationalization.
* Additional crates, which you can explore in the `Cargo.toml` files of PageTop and its packages.


# ‚å®Ô∏è Code

PageTop includes code from [config-rs](https://crates.io/crates/config) (version
[0.11.0](https://github.com/mehcode/config-rs/tree/0.11.0)) by
[Ryan Leckey](https://crates.io/users/mehcode), chosen for its advantages in reading configuration
settings and delegating assignment to safe types, tailored to the specific needs of each package,
theme, or application.
