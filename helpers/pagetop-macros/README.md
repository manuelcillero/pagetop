# ðŸ“¦ About PageTop

**PageTop** framework is currently in active development. The API is unstable and subject to
frequent changes. Production use is not recommended until version **0.1.0**.


# ðŸ”– Credits

This crate includes an adapted version of [maud-macros](https://crates.io/crates/maud_macros),
